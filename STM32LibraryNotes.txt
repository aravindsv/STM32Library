To use timer:
1. Set bit 0 of EGR to reinitialize the counter (including prescaler)
2. set ARR. ARR contains period, frequency will be HSI_VALUE/PSC/ARR
3. If ARR >= 65536, increase prescaler to achieve the same frequency with lower ARR
4. Enable APB1 Clock
4. Enable the counter by setting bit 0 of CR1

To Use timer in PWM Mode:
1. Set bit 7 of CR1 to enable Auto Reload of ARR value
2. Enable output channel in CCER
3. Set output mode in CCMR1/2
4. Set alternate function mode in AFR depending on which timer is being used
5. Duty cycle will be value of CCR register

To use timer in encoder mode:
Relevant registers:
- CCRx is used to latch the value of the counter after transition is detected
- SR will have flag set when a capture occurs, CCxIF bit. This will be cleared when data is read from CCRx
Procedure:
1. Select active input. Write CC1S bits in CCMRx to 01 (or just not 00)
2. Program filter duration in ICxF bits on CCMRx
3. Select active edge with CC1P and CC1NP in CCER
4. Input Prescaler if needed, if not needed then write IC1PS bits in CCMRx to 00
5. Enable capture from counter into capture register by setting CC1E bit in CCER

ADC:
1. Enable clock
2. Set ADON bit in CR2
Conversion doesnâ€™t start until SWSTART or JWSTART is set
Single Conversion Mode:
1. CONT bit to 0
2.
Regular Channel: set SWSTART bit in CR2
Injected Channel: set JSWSTART bit in CR2
3. 
Regular Channel: EOC flag will be set, read from DR register
Injected Channel: JEOC flag will be set, read from JDR1 register
Continuous Conversion Mode:
1. CONT bit to 1 (set SWSTRT bit in CR2 for regular channels)
